Captain's log: Guybrush Threepwood. Lost at sea for days now.  I have no crew or navigational instruments. No provisions except a half-eaten corn-dog and, unless I find water soon, I'm surely done for. Only the hope of finding my love, Elaine, keeps me going.
My quest for the fabulous treasure called Big Whoop ha left me in this sorry state. I thought it would bring me fame and glory. Instead, it delivered me into the clutches of my enemy, the zombie-pirate LeChuck. I had thwarted his evil plot to marry Elaine and he was after revenge.
Really, really thirsty now. If only I could have a small drink of fresh water, I might have the strength to sail on.
Oh, but I know there's nothing but ocean for miles and miles...  If I could reach land, I might find water and some food. Fruit, maybe... something to fight off the scurvy and help me get my strength back. Mmmmmm... maybe some bananas...
Oh, why do I torture myself like this? I might as well wish for some chicken and a big mug of grog for all the good it will do me.
Oh, my sweet Elaine... am I cursed to starve here on this ocean... without seeing your face just one more time? Am I--
Elaine!
I've got to get out of here and help Elaine!
If I could only get through this one door... ...then I could easily overpower the armed guards above... ...slip over the side and make for the shore.
If there are any of you stinking, wretched fiends of the damned in there... ...could you open this door? It's not that I'm trying to escape or anything.  It's just that I'd like to step outside and enjoy an adult beverage.
I can't quite squeeze past this cannon.
There's a strange glow coming from that porthole.
It's a brightly lit porthole.
I'm Guybrush Threepwood, who are you?
You don't scare me, you mangy pirate!
I'm selling these fine leather jackets
No. I'm lying.
Yep, sorry we couldn't make a deal.
You sound pretty tough.
How tough are you again?
How tough are you again?
Ooooh!
Well, I'm pretty tough myself!
Hey... How did you know about my attempted beard?
I am so tough!
Yes, I am!
Are you wearing a fake beard?
Yes, it is!
It's been glued to your ear hair!
Is that hook for real?
It is so a fake!
Hey! Wait a minute! You're not a pirate! Wally! Don't you recognize me?  It's Guybrush Threepwood!
The last time I saw you, we were prisoners in LeChuck's dungeon. Why would you sign on with a ship of the living dead?
Tell me about these seminars.
Tell me about these motivational lectures.
Tell me about these audio books.
Do you have any literature I could look at?
I'm not in the mood for sales hype.
Set me free, Wally.
What's behind that door?
Hmmmm... What are LeChuck's plans?
Snap out of it, Wally!
You're a failure as a pirate
Peep.
Word.
Oh. There, there.
I don't want to slap the little guy around.
I don't want to disturb him.  He's had a hard day.
I see a diorama of the children of the world living in peace and freedom.
No, wait. It can't be that. It's just too dark to make out what's in there.
Nice cannon balls.
They're too heavy to carry.
Whoops!
That was me. Sorry.
Sorry about that!
My fault!
Ouch.
Hey! I'm getting pretty good at this...
Ewww, gross... all the bones and stuff are floating towards the ship.
Lose something?
Uh-huh.
No.
You know, you'd look great with a melting candle on your forehead.
No, I am.  Really.
Eeek.
Why do you villains always laugh so much?
Can I call you BOB?
"Stride?"
You're about as fearsome as a doorstop
Uh, never mind.
Was your mother's father bald too?
Well, at least now you never have to worry about what to wear.
And accessorizing is really easy.
There you go. How can you see without eyeballs?
It's been swell talking to ya.
Whatever.
I'm going now.
If I gave you your arm back, what would you do with it?
Nope. You blew it
That doesn't need cutting.
I can't use the skeleton arm with that.
Ha-ha! Taste cold steel, feeble cannon restraint rope!
Hey! I lost my cutlass when the ship capsized.
It's got a zombie ballerina.
Hey! I can see the ocean floor. And there's a really angry-looking skull floating around out there.
It's the biggest pile of treasure I've ever seen!
I wouldn't be able to swim with all that treasure. I'll leave it here and come back for it when I have a boat.
I hate to think what that comb's been through.
I think LeChuck needs it more than I do.
I don't even want to know what LeChuck's plans were for that.
No self-respecting pirate would be seen wearing that.
It's LeChuck in all his gory. Err, glory
It's a bag of wooden nickels. Some treasure.
Hey! There's a big diamond ring behind this bag!
If only I could find a way to get up there and get out!
Yes, Elaine!
Umm... did you really mean what you said out there? ...That I was the only man you ever loved?
Elaine, I'm a man of action. A swashbuckler. A rouge. A wanderer! A man who can hold his breath for ten minutes. I have no ties and no regrets. I sail with the wind and go where adventure takes me. But somehow, something always leads me...
Elaine, will you marry me?
Oh, --WALLY?!! You're alive! Uh, but, how did you survive the explosion?!!
Oh no!  Elaine!
She's not going to be happy about this
Elaine?  Honey?  You okay? Can I get you anything? I'll just start lifting that pirate curse, then, huh?
She must weigh a ton!  Uh, no offense. Hey, I wonder how many karats she... No, no. Bad idea.
Fun.
Hi.
Ouch.
It's an informative plaque put up by the Plunder Island Naturalist Society. "Plunder Island Feral Chicken. One of Plunder Island's most common fauna, and the animal for which our capital of Puerto Pollo is named."
I don't think so.
Mysterious.
AHHHHH!
Oh, it's just you again.
Yeah, right.
How'd you get all the way up there?
Uh huh.
Do you need me to help you down?
Okay, just thought I'd ask.
What are you doing up there?
Standing?
How long are you going to keep doing that?
Must get pretty dull up there, I suppose.
You seem restless.
What would you rather be doing?
That would make you happy?
Do you know anything about lifting curses?
You seem bitter.
I'd love to stay and chat, but ...uh... I've got to go
I think he wants to be alone right now
Wow! I got a whole pack of gum!
I don't need it. It's just a toy.
I'm sure it won't do anything. After all, it's just a paper voodoo-doll.
Who are you and how did you just appear like that?
You're a fashion consultant?
Neat!
Don't I know you from somewhere?
Hang on a second. Are we going to do one of those flashback things? They always make me nauseous.
I'm starting to remember...
That's right! You've helped so much and I still don't know your name.
Yes, you're right... Hey! Are you making fun of me?
Boy, have I got some stories to tell you!
But I've got to tell you about LeChuck! And Elaine!
No, no, no, wait! It started back on Dinky Island. I knew LeChuck was close...
Okay, okay. No stories. Nice place. I love what you've done with it.
Perhaps later.
Hey, you're good! Something terrible HAS happened! I finally proposed to Elaine!
And when I placed the engagement ring on her hand she was placed under a horrible pirate curse and trapped for eternity as a solid gold statue!
Yeah, that LeChuck was a pretty mean guy.
There's no time to worry about that now! We have to hurry!
Err... I can't tell you. It's too secret.
Err... I just remembered something I've got to do. Uh, see you around!
ELAINE! I've got to get her back! This is so embarrassing. It looks like I'm going to need some more help.
Someone's stolen Elaine!
Do you know who kidnapped her?
Can you give me something to lift the curse?
Great! Tell me!
Where am I going to find a huge, uncursed diamond ring?
Blood Island? I've never heard of it.
Uh huh. So, uh, any huge uncursed rings on any other islands?
Die? Did, did you say, "Die?" As in, me? Dead?
Isn't there a less... dangerous way?
Oh, that's sweet. I...I think I have something in my eye.
How do I get to Blood Island?
Map, ship, and crew. Got it. Well, how will I find the ring on Blood Island?
Blood Island sounds dangerous! Ya have to come with me!
But who will point me in the right direction? You've got to come! You're my only hope!
Blood Island, here I come! I finally defeated LeChuck and his skeleton pirates!
But I heard him blow up and everything!
How can I finally destroy him for good?
I finally found Big Whoop and was enormously disappointed!
I can't remember much about it... just that I was expecting so much more, and felt so let down.
Well, I'm never going back there again.
What makes you think LeChuck will be back?
Gee, when you put it that way, it's kind of hard to stay mad at him. What island is this, anyway?
Plunder Island. Sounds appropriately piratey.
Hmmm. Sounds... exciting.
Elaine is governor of this island, too?
How did you end up on Plunder Island?
So you moved to a swamp on a different island?
What about this giant chicken business?
Don't you think you're being a bit over-dramatic?
AHHHHHHHHHHHH!
Oh. Sorry. Go ahead.
No, no, no, wait. Don't tell me. Let me guess... He's crossing the road... to freedom!
Oh, give me a break.
Yeah, right. Whatever. Thanks, I've heard all I needed to know. I want to know what voodoo spell you're working on.
Does it have any skink toes in it?
I'll pass. I want to know more about safe hair replacement systems.
I sure did! A really cool one! I wonder what happened to it... I want to know more about a diet I can live with.
What's that?
I want to know more about variable-rate mortgages.
Could you repeat that?
I want to know more about a career in TV and VCR repair.
Sure, we all do!
I want to know more about the Aztec god, Quetzalcoatl
Thanks for your help. Gotta go!
Hey Murray, remember this?
What would you do with it without your collarbone?
Hey, Murray...
Hey, Murray, check this out!
Rubbed paste all over it.
Are you guys pirate barbers?
Great! Maybe you guys can help me find this huge diamond ring I'm looking for
Yeah! It's supposedly enormous, and it's on Blood Island!
It's a funny story, really: I need it to lift this curse that's turned my girlfriend into a solid gold statue!
Wait a second. Did I just share too much?
Ahoy there! I'm Guybrush Threepwood, mighty pirate.
Okay, then... who are you?
Not THE...
Dude! How'd you like to join my ever-growing pirate crew?
It's going to be a blast! We're going to Blood Island!
Gentleman? That's me all over!
All right. Let's get to dueling!
Hmmm... okay. Hey, that's a nice shirt... How long have you been colorblind?
Nice cologne you're wearing... Did you actually roll around in dung, or just dab a little behind each ear?
Did I mention you're a big old bed-wetting doody-head?
How appropriate. You fight like a cow
I don't want to insult you! Why can't we just get along? You went from pirating to hairstyling. Why?
Through affordably-priced sea shanty compilation albums?
By hanging out at the docks and singing to passing sailors?
Obviously. But there are only three of you.
You still haven't explained why you chose hairstyling.
Oh, my feet are killing me.
Huh? Oh. I'm sorry, my mind was wandering. Please go on.
Are you truly happy with this line of work?
I could be the fourth for your barbershop quartet!
Ah, come on!  I've really got a way with a ballad!
Oh, there's a monkey in my pocket, and he's stealing all my change. His stare is blank and glassy, I suspect that he's deranged....
Pretty good, huh?
So what are you telling me, exactly? Let me try out for your barbershop quartet again!
Oh please!  Please!  The spirit of music is in me!
Once my old man spoke to good King Triton And asked "Why all this senseless fightin'? Why can't we men express emotion?" Now I've got a friend in the...
What do you think, huh?
Let me try another song for your barbershop quartet!
Come on, this time will be great. Trust me.
Plunder, Plunder, how I wonder, How'd you get so doggone pretty? Home to sailors, barbers, tailors and Puerto Pollo, your capitol [sic] city...
Well...?
Listen to me sing again. You'll love it this time.
No, believe me!  I'm just getting warmed up.
I'm hooked on you, baby, but the seas keep us apart. And there ain't no eyepatch big enough to cover up my broken heart...
I'm not following you -- is that a good thing?
I've got one song left for you.  It's a showstopper!
For those cold, dark shipboard nights, we've got boxers, briefs, and tights made from cotton, silk, or satin, in styles Anglo, Dutch, and Latin, when you sail don't take a chance wearing nothing 'neath your pants! Trust... Silver's Long Johns!
What? What? You liked it?
I bet you have a ton of cool pirate stories
Come on! I'd really like to hear some of...
Had your ship been placed under some kind of pirate curse?
Were you haunted by the spiteful ghost of a former captain?
Hey, that's kind of catchy!
Whoa! Look at the time. Gotta scoot.
Ahoy there! I'm Guybrush Threepwood, mighty pirate.
So... it's good to meet you, Mister...?
Bill? That's your pirate name? Bill?
Oh, I see. Well, that puts a whole new spin on it, doesn't it?
Are you ever going back to pirating?
Perfect! I'll be your captain... onward to Blood Island and high adventure! Want to come?
I'm the mighty pirate who defeated LeChuck!
I've got a ton of cool stories..
Well, I've got these nickels.
Err, yeah.
I bet I could find more gold than you've ever seen!
Well, I've got these nickels.
How'd you break into the hairstyling industry?
No! That must be very rewarding work.
Mean? Just that... you know, cutting hair, and, err, singing must be just... a lot of fun.
Okay!  New topic. Do you really enjoy being a barber?
Pirate stories. Got any?
Supernatural powers? I have a hard time believing that.
Is this going to be scary? Because I warn you, I've been known to leap into the arms of total strangers when startled.
Good point. Please go on
Your captain sounds like a real freak show.
How long is this story, anyway?
Will do!
Wait a second... was it an enormous pile of jewelry and gold coins and belt buckles at the bottom of the bay?
Eh, just had a feeling. Do you know any more pirate stories?
Is something troubling you? Say, uh, whatcha eating there?
Is it good?
You don't say much, do you?
That's a really good jawbreaker there, huh?
Well. That's just terrific, isn't it?
Boy, I sure could go for a jawbreaker right about now.
I said, "I sure could go for a jawbreaker right about now."
You going to finish that jawbreaker?
Okay. Just checking. Nothing I love more than a good jawbreaker!
Heh. See? When you look at it that way, we're really not all that different, you and I.
Could I have your jawbreaker?
It's been a pleasure. Bye.
You know, I really appreciate you taking the time to talk to me. I think we've, well, we've bonded.
Hi.
Oh, it was nothing, really. Just sudden pressure applied below the sternum to expel a foreign object from the windpipe.
Yes?
Ahoy there! I'm Guybrush Threepwood, and I'm a mighty pi... ...rate. Huh?
Ahoy there! I'm Guybrush Threepwood!
I'm a mighty pirate.
What did you mean, "Ha?"
I'm mighty enough to defeat LeChuck! Twice!
So you're a ship captain, huh?
I've never heard of Captain Rottingham.
Well, how'd you like to join my crew?
Why don't you want to join my crew?
Now just one second...
Well, I didn't want you on my crew anyway.
Did you know you're starting to go gray?
Eh, don't get me wrong. Gray hair suits you
If I were you, I'd worry more about those split ends.
You've got a bald spot starting here in the back.
If you say so. All I know is that there's definitely some kind of shine going on back here. You seem irritable. Is it from your dry scalp?
Eeeh. THAT's a little more than I wanted to know
They're doing great things with dandruff shampoo these days.
Fire! Run for your life!
Rabid dogs are on the loose! Get out now!
That's just what they WANT you to think! There's an ax-wielding maniac at the door! Flee!
The calls are coming from within the barber shop! You must get out immediately!
Storm's a-coming. Better get a move on. Could be a twister.
Captain Rottingham? You're being paged.
You know, sitting down for too long can be unhealthy. It's a serious risk to your cardiovascular system. I think a nice jog could be just what you need right about now.  Up and at 'em!
You know, sitting down for too long can be unhealthy.
You seem busy.  I'll come back later.
"In memory of the chickens who gave their lives... ...during the Great Puerto Pollo Potluck Jamboree of 1621."
That's weird. I didn't think dandruff...  ...moved... Oh!
I'd hate people to think less of this guy just because of a slight problem with... Hey, this isn't dandruff... Oh!
They're, uh, wiggling.
It looks like there's something inside the pocket of this coat.
There's a glove in here.
It's empty... ...or is it?
Watch me make THIS disappear.
Nothing up my sleeve..
Presto! Hey, it worked! There's something inside!
"The A-mfggh-C's of Ventriloquism"
Hey! It's a sticker from Blood Island! It says "Blood Island is for bleeders... ...a message from the Blood Island Tourism Council."  Maybe the performer who owns this trunk knows how to get to Blood Island!
It's very mod.
The magic wand has no effect on that.
It's a book about ventriloquism. Say hello to the folks, Harry
Please someone help!  I'm trapped inside this trunk!
I don't want to throw my voice there.
You're no actor! Get off the stage, ya bum!
That was funny once.
Yo. I'm a dangerous pirate, who are you?
What was your given name?
I see. What's that putrid stench-ridden drivel that you're rehearsing?
Do pirates drink grog?
You re-wrote Shakespeare?
Why can't you go back to the original scripts?
Why do I find that strangely encouraging? Can I watch you rehearse your horrible play?
Of course. C'mon. Let me watch you rehearse.
PUH-LEEZE can I watch you rehearse?
Romeo and Juliet die
C'mon. Let me watch you rehearse.
PUH-LEEZE can I watch you rehearse?
Can I join your show?
You have no idea how often I hear that.Acting is my life! Let me join your show! I was a tree in my kindergarten play.
Acting is my life!  Let me join your show!
Of course, what I really want to do is direct.
Can I join your show?
PUH-LEEZE can I join your show?
Have you been to Blood Island?
Acting is my life! Let me join your show
Oh, what did you perform?
Could you tell me how I can find Blood Island?
Any idea where I could find him?
Carry on.
So how'd you get roped into doing this show?
How surprising.
Break a peg-leg.
"Prop Tree. Fake trees of this genus were often used by early settlers for theatrical productions."
Excuse me..
He's a member of the bustling Plunder Island workforce.
My name is Guybrush Threepwood, and I'm a mighty pirate.
Who?
You don't need to see my identification.
I'm not the pirate you're looking for.
I can go about my business.
Move along.
I don't want an amenity. I had to eat one of those while I was lost at sea and it was terrible.
Shave me like a yak.
Tee Hee!
I'd like a crew-cut, please.
I don't think he'd like that.
Good analogy.
Rash? That's a bad sign.
Ahoy there! I'm Guybrush Threepwood, here to serve all your mighty pirate needs
How did you become a barber pirate?
So how did that help you become a barber pirate
Ah. Do you know any rousing pirate stories?
Bulky Island? Where's that?
Why didn't you work in pairs or groups of three or four?
How would you like to join my crew?
Helping you move?
I was just kidding. Was that really the test of strength?
Oh, but in school I was always picked last for caber tossing.
That's just about the stupidest sport I've ever heard of. And I watch cable television.
Ahhh, toss THIS.
"Haggis."  That's an unusual name.
Oh, so your parents were expecting a girl.
What is that blue stuff in the jar, anyway?
Those sure are nice scissors.
Why are they in the ceiling?
Could I, uh, borrow those scissors for a minute?
Yes, I believe you mentioned that. When I think of all I could do with those scissors...
Did I mention how nice those scissors are?
And they can cut through anything. Please let me borrow those scissors.
I sure could use a haircut.
But what about my haircut?
I just remembered. I have another appointment.
It's the handle the barber uses to raise and lower the chair.
I choose the banjo!
You do?
He's good.  I'll never beat him.
You can't be sure of that. That shot may have come from the grassy knoll.
Great!
I'll need two more sailors for my crew.
I wonder if this plaque says something about the flower I just cut. "Ipecac (Cephaelis ipecacuanha). One of the creeping vines common throughout Plunder Island. A syrup made from ipecac flowers was used by the early settlers of Plunder Island as a purgative."
Hmmm... I wonder what this sign means... Snake crossing?  What possible harm could a snake...
Well, this isn't good.
I can't reach it!
"Massive, Man-Eating Snake. This fantastic reptile is one of Plunder Island's most dangerous and beautiful predators."
I bet that ship I saw belongs to the pirates who've stolen Elaine!
I can't see it, but I bet it's Snake-Away™ brand snake repellant.
Hmmm.
It's a priceless, delicate Fabergé egg.
It's a complete array of vacuum cleaner attachments.
I hate to think what would happen if these fell into the wrong hands
I'd love to punch him one, but I don't want to make him angry.
He's not going for the flower just by itself.
I don't know how to mix the flower with that.
It makes syrup of ipecac. That seems logical.
Whew! That sure was a close one! I thought for sure when I got eaten by that snake that I was done for! Thank goodness I'm... ...safe... ...now... Hey!
Hang on, the quicksand is sucking all the cool stuff I found in that snake from my pants. Now THERE's an odd sensation.
It's a bunch of conveniently-placed hollow reeds.
I can't move anywhere in this quicksand!
If I could just reach that vine, I could pull myself free.
I can't reach it.
It's a branch resting precariously on that tree root.
My aim is always off when I'm under stress. I might miss. If only I had some sense of dropping the weight on the branch from directly above.
"Quicksand Pit. Quicksand pits of this type are common throughout Plunder Island's nature trails. Many an unwary traveler has found himself trapped and unable to esca... uh-oh. Someone anyone please please help me I'm sinking!"
"Pappapisshu Bush. Discovered by Plunder Island's indigenous peoples, this bush is named after a native word meaning 'Youch!'"
Pappapisshu!  Well, I got the thorn. I hope that was worth it
I've got nothing to say.
Neat. A world-class pea-shooter.
Shooting the vine won't do any good.
Even if I could hit the branch with that, it wouldn't do any good.
It's just floating there.
I'd better not put it away just yet. I think I'm onto something here.
Perfect!  For once today, things are going...
Well, darn.
Hey!
Thank goodness for those unpredictable Caribbean trade winds!
It's got a huge hole in the bottom.  I'd sink.
It's a nice boat except for that enormous gaping hole in the bottom.
Those must be the pirates who've taken Elaine!
"Feeling down 'cause your chick's turned to gold? Come to the swamp! Get your fortune told! Voodoo 'n' Things. (Formerly Just Voodoo. Visit our new location on Plunder Island.)"
"Blondebeard's Chicken Shoppe."  It's the two-way speaker for the walk-thru.
Hello?
I can't understand you, what was that?
Ah, forget it.
Of course I have a reservation!
Excuse me, but...
Me?
I have?
Oh.
I'll have the, eh, broasted wattle molé
How's the ipecac slaw?
Would you like to join my crew and sail to Blood Island?
Whoa! Calm down. I was just asking
What's wrong?
The devil chicken.
What's he done?
Do you have any specials?
No thanks. Do you have any other specials?
No thanks. Do you have any other specials?
To whom were you going to deliver your chicken?
Why is that?
What are the pirates of Danjer Cove like?
To whom were you going to deliver your chicken?
How long have you been out of chickens?
No?
Isn't that a little hard on your teeth?
What do you miss most about your chicken?
Nice gold tooth you have there
Did I mention how much I admire your gold tooth?
Don't you ever like to get outside the shop?
Don't you ever like to get outside the shop
I'll let you get back to work.
The devil chicken.
Eeeew! This biscuit is full of... maggots!
"Biscuits and More." I wonder what the "more" is.
Value Meal: Two drumsticks plus super slaw. Looks like a fine deal if you like slaw.
Braaakk!
It is I, the spirit of El Pollo Diablo!
Just kidding.
Excuse me...  Sir?
Now that's just rude.
He's awfully reserved for a pirate.
Hey! Mister. Mister, are you listening?
Ah! It's one of LeChuck's skeletal horde!
Mmmm. The undead that walk among us must surely be destroyed lest their evil like... ...overrun and befoul the world of the living.
Oh.
It says, "Ask Me About Grim Fandango™."
What can you tell me about "Grim Fandango™?"
Anything?
I don't like to speak ill of the dead... ...but this guy's lousy at marketing.
Waiter, what's this metatarsal doing in my soup?
I don't want people always asking me about Grim Fandango™
This is the greasiest, crustiest, most revolting chicken I've ever seen!
I can't eat that. The fumes alone would kill me.
Yuck.
"Brimstone Beach Club. Member Since 1632."
Would you like this jawbreaker?
Would you like some gum?
Mmm... tastes like sirloin!
The gold tooth is in the gum.
Hmm. That's made my voice sound funny
Cool!
Um... no?
I wonder where that tooth fell.
It's the gold tooth!
There are ants crawling all over it.
Oooh, my head is spinning.  I've got to lay off the rum.
Check this out.
So you'll join my crew?
I'll need one more sailor for my crew
Are you sure you don't want to join my crew
Sounds great!  Let's do it!
Hey, I win!
Well, I've got my whole crew.
Excuse me.
My card...
Yes. And I think I'll just take one of your fluffy, clean towels... ...and enjoy a nice, relaxing stroll down your beach.
I must. And perhaps I'll sunbathe nude.
Quiet! The voices in my head are telling me something.
Oh, cabaña boy?
It's quite hot. Fetch a towel and mop my brow, would you?
Uh... actually the towels are right here.  I'll just help myself.
Nice, fluffy towel.
May I please have some of your oil?
This towel is soaking wet.
Nice, fluffy towel. I'll just take one more.
I've got enough towels.
The towels are all wet now.
Chicken franks! Chock full of processed beaks and wattles!
Hot! Hot!
With these holes in my shoes I'll never get across that hot beach.
Whew!
I'm Guybrush Threepwood.
Finally... ...someone on this island with some manners.
I don't think you understand. I'm a mighty pirate.
It's me again...
Look here, you...
Wow! You're pale!
How long have you been out here?
I've seen correctional fluids with better color than you!
You look like you've lived under a rock your WHOLE life!
You've got the SAVAGE pale!
Hey! I can see my reflection in your chest
You're so pale, you make snow look tan!
If I bleached chalk it wouldn't be as pale as you!
Yes.
Would you like to join my crew?
You're a project leader on a computer game?
Are you sure you won't join my crew?
I'm looking for Blood Island. Do you know where it is?
Are you sure you don't know how to get to Blood Island?
That's funny. Slappy Cromwell... ...told me you booked all his shows there.
So you do know how to get to Blood Island!
On your back?
Oh. Why did you lie and say you didn't know how to get to Blood Island?
What?
It's Blood Island or nothing.
Can I see your map to Blood Island?
You can see it when I roll over to tan my back.
See ya around.
Hello there, sonny. Are you open yet?
That does sound like a good deal. Is the lemonade good?
Wow! What's the lemonade good for?
Will it cure evil pirate curses?
I'd like to buy some lemonade.
Hey! There's no bottom to this mug! Give me my money back!
Why, you little...
I want my money back!
I don't know, I didn't drink any.
But..
I'm bigger than him. I'm no bully.
Are you going to give me my money back?
Give me some more lemonade, you little chiseler.
Ahhhh. That was as refreshing as morning dew!
It's full of dye now.
I'd rather go around to the gate than go through that towel business again.
I've brought you a new mug.
Here's your drink, sir.
Look, Palido! You're burning!
Good idea.
I'll never memorize that map. It's far too complex.
Because of his sunburn, the map on Palido's back is peeling off
I really wish I didn't have to do that
It's the map to Blood Island, peeled off Palido's back.
The plug is all pasty now.
Perfect!
I'll never be able to pick that up.
I'm Guybrush Threepwood, and I want my girlfriend!
Your captain?
LeCh...!
Couldn't you just let me off with a stern warning?
I regret that I have but one life to give for love!
I'll be back to kill you all!
SPLASH!
It's a big old sloppy bucket o' tar.
Hmmm.
So what do I do now?
I guess so.  But no more than usual.
He's asleep.
I'm out of here.
Oops!
Uh-Oh!
¿Qué?
Uh, that's right.
Bluch! This chicken grease washed off all the feathers.  Whoops. I'd better keep quiet
LeChimp? The captain is an ape?  Well, if the captain is an ape... ...then Mr. Fossey must be...
..an utter loon.
Ahh! I HATE porcelain! It's a long story. I'll explain later.
Uh, testing... testing... uh, check... one... two... uh, three..
Ahem. Mr. Fossey, I've been thinking...
Don't interrupt!
Maybe it's time we gave up pirating. I mean, take a look around, at me, at the rest of the crew... ...We're all monkeys.
No, I mean in the quite literal sense. Have you noticed that the crew is happier swinging from the masts than swabbing the decks? I don't even want to MENTION what they've been flinging around the ship..
No, no, I'm suggesting that we all give up this charade and go back to the trees. That's the life for a monkey, not sailing the seas for months on end!
I think our last order of business should be to dig up that statue, and...
Okay, but first, we should dig up that statue and give it to...
Very good, and then we can dig up that statue and...
Okay, never mind then.
That must be the map to where they've buried Elaine!
I think Mr. Fossey is the only guy who can talk to him.
I don't want to get the kernels stuck in my teeth.
Whoops!  There's no rowboat!
Oh, I just can't watch.
It smells like something's burning... Hmph... must be this shoddy seventeenth-century electrical wiring. Wait a second... somebody's been monkeying around with these controls!
That's it! That must be where Elaine is buried!
He's a great juggler, but I sure wish he'd get off the stage so I can dig Elaine up.
Drop it! Drop it!
Uh-oh! It looks like he's coming for the cannon balls now!
I'm glad it had a happy ending and he got the... um... got the girl in the end.
Elaine should be safe up in the crow's nest... ...for now.
It's a torn-up contract with something scrawled on it.  It says...
"To my agent, Palido Domingo: Palido, this is the worst booking you've given me since that fire-walking fiasco on Blood Island.  I quit!  Sincerely, Slappy Cromwell."
Well, I've got a crew, a map, a ship, and finally got Elaine back... ...So what say we head on to Blood Island! To lift the curse and save Elaine!
How about it, guys? Let's get moving towards Blood Island! Let's head on out and find our fortune! Guys?
I think that ship is following us.
It's a pirate ship! We've got to outrun her!
All right, men! Are you with me!
That ship is gaining on us. Cutthroat Bill! Rig the topsail!
They're boarding us! Crew! Help me out here
Rottingham! So it's you! What do you want, other than a good toupee?
Look, baldy, I'll never give you that map! I need it to save Elaine!
Of course! Everybody knows that, chrome dome! Let's get this over with.
Oh, yeah!  Well... You fight like a cow!
What?
What!?
I once found some gold but it was just electro-plated.
Uhhh.
I... uh, I...
Uh... here! Take it!
I've got to get that map back or we'll never find Blood Island. Thanks, guys. You were a world of help back there.
Oh, this is just ridiculous.
Come on, men!  We've got to recover that map!
Let's go defeat that evil pirate!
All right, crew, let's get to work!
No, it wasn't.
No time for song! We've got to move!
Less singing, more sailing.
I'm getting so sick of you guys and your rhyming.
Stop! Stop! Stop!
You say you're nasty pirates... ...scheming, thieving, bad bushwhackers? From what I've seen I tell you... ...you're not pirates! You're just slackers!
We'll surely avoid scurvy if we all eat an orange.
Well, gee. I feel a little guilty, now.
Yes, Mr. McMutton?
What do you mean, Haggis?
I see.
I love a tough sea battle as much as the next captain!
I think I'd rather let you guys help me out.
Uhhh... Haggis?
What am I doing here?
Never mind.
I think I'd like full tactical control, now.
No, I'm terrible at folding up maps.
I'm Guybrush Threepwood! A mighty pirate!
Yer treasure or yer life!
I've come to plunder your treasure!
Treasure? You wanted treasure?  I'm sorry, I'm fresh out.
If I had treasure, don't you think I'd spend it before grappling with the likes of you?
I haven't got any treasure. Why do you think I was attacking you?
Well, if I had any, you'd be the first one to get it.
I guess I need more practice with this swordfighting stuff. At least I showed 'em in the high-seas-combat part...
Give me your treasure! Ya bath sized sea-sponge!
Give me your treasure!
Give me your treasure! Ya grubby bilge swigger!
Give me your treasure! You filthy unwashed thing, you!
Give me your treasure! Ya reeking, musty, stench-soaked freebooter!
Give me your treasure! Ya wax-covered swab!
What!?
We're loaded with booty!
Well, well, well.
Winners never cheat, and cheaters never win.
What is it?
Tell me you're lying.
I'm a Fearsome Pirate.
What do you have for sale today
I'll take the "Buccaneer's Buddy!"
My ship's hold is full of booty
Would you take my old cannons as a trade in?
We lost a sea battle! How humiliating for a pirate of my skill and expeience.
We lost again! What am I doing wrong? 
I really shouldn't pick on those poor, defenseless tourists. It's not good for business on the island. They do make for good cannon fodder, though.
I'd like to buy some cannons for my pirate ship. I'll take the "Ouch-Master!"
I'll take the "Holemaker Deluxe!"
I'd like to buy some cannons for my pirate ship. I'll take the "Destructomatic T-47!"
Give me my map, you fiend!
You'll never get away with this, René!
So give me that map, take your ship and skedaddle!
You were doomed from the start, you kleptomaniac!
It's no wonder you lost with a sword so unsteady!
Your smell and face remind me of moldy old cheese!
We got the map back!  Now we can sail to Blood Island!
We've got to keep her on course for Blood Island!
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!
Van Helgen?!!
Whew! I guess I blacked out for a second. Where's Elaine?
Then let's get going! We'll find her then scour the island for the uncursed diamond ring that will transform her back to normal.
What do ye mean... I mean... What do you mean, Haggis?
Did I mention that I'm offering my crew a very attractive pension plan?
But why, Haggis?  Why?
You're going back to being barbers?
I guess I'm on my own again.
Uh, Haggis...
Are you sure you don't want to be pirates again?
Of course. Join me or I'll KILL you all!
Um... no.
Are you sure you don't want to be pirates again?
Oh, shoot... How are the repairs coming?
You mutineers had best beware!
Nice.
Well, for one thing... I'll put a terrible pirate curse on you!
I guess that's not much of a threat.
Well, for one thing... You'll be driven to madness by the shame of your own guilt.
Well, for one thing... The sea hates a deserter, and she'll swallow you up.
Oh, shucks. I always get those two confused.
Well, for one thing... If I wore a kilt, I wouldn't wear highly polished shoes.
You mutineers had best beware!
My, that's a big bottle of lotion you have there.
Wow! If I were doing a history report on pirates and I included that fact I'd get an A+. We're talkin' GUARANTEED A+. And that A+ just might get you into the college of your choice. Think about it.
There's no way that I can have even a drop of lotion?
I'll let you get back to work.
It's a bottle of "Cap'n Nick's Shaving Soap" with a cork in it. It must've fallen from the barbers' supplies when the ship wrecked.
Hi there!
Hi, I'm Guybrush. And you would be...?
Cool! You're a fortune-teller!
Whatever. Tell me my fortune
Aw, but I'm already ignorant of so many things! I want to know my future!
I bet you just can't do it. That's the problem. You can't do it, and you're afraid everyone will find out you're just a phony.
So are you going to tell me my fortune or not?
Okay, okay. Do you know anything about the lost ring of Blood Island?
Where is the diamond?
What's in the cards for me? Fame? Fortune? Romance?
What is it? Is that a good AIEEEEEE?
Well... In the tarot, "Death" just means "Change", right? I mean, it's nothing to get worried about, right?
Look! A three-headed monkey!
Huh, he must've run away.
There must be some mistake. Read my tarot cards again.
I'm feeling luckier. Give me another tarot reading.
Whatever. Let's see what the cards say this time.
Okay, okay.
Hit me.
How many of those cards do you have, anyway?
How about giving me one more tarot reading?
Okay, I get your point, I really do. Just one more time. For Guybrush
Let me guess... DEATH?
Huh?
Oh yeah?  Well...
Madame Xima, I...
"Madame Eczema"
"Drink grog"
Hmmm.
It's labeled "Goodsoup Family Records".
No thanks, I'm not THAT hungry.
Hi, I'm Guybrush Threepwood, and I'm...
I wasn't yelling, I was just...
What was that I...
*Hwwaaaaccck...  ...tooo!*
I can't see anyone in there right now.
It's a Black Beard's [sic] Deck-Maker Workbench.
It's a scrap metal recycling bin
It's beginning to spell a word. What could it be? Rib-roast? Riboflavin?
It says, "Old Blind Pew."
I don't want that.
Someone should really learn to properly extinguish campfires.
Bark!
Woof!
Arf Arf!
Hm, he's just not very social, I guess
Hey, I guess it didn't hurt a bit. He must be shedding.
Ow! He bit me!
I don't think he'd like that
I can't reach it.
I can't shake it hard enough with just my hands
Those advertisements were no lie. It really is crystal clear.
Well, if you insist...
I really don't want to go in the ocean.
Hmmm... That guy probably couldn't hold his breath underwater for very long. Too bad.
I hope it was worth it for you.
It's sharp. I'd better be careful.
It's too barnacle-encrusted to be very useful
I'm no sword-swallower.
Litterbugs. Sharp, though
I'm not a garbage collector.
Whatever was in that bottle is long gone.
VERY sharp.
VERY hazardous to my delicate skin.
I already have the barber's scissors, why would I need these?
Sharp and dangerous.
Carrying around a meat cleaver is just going to get somebody hurt.
I wonder if it was ever used to kill anyone.
Too bad he couldn't reach any of this sharp stuff
Euuu! No way!
Uh, hi there, corpse.
Actually, it's more like a fabulous doorstop.
If that was light enough to be carried by one person... ...don't you think this guy would have just picked it up?
I don't think it would talk back to me.
Looks sharp.
I don't want to cut myself.
I can't talk to a hacksaw.
Rusty, but sharp.
I could get tetanus if I prick my finger with that.
It's not a very efficent-looking toothpick.
The egg would break when it hit the ground.
This is some of the hair of the dog that bit me!
I found this egg for your hangover remedy!
Here's a wild pepper for your hangover remedy!
I'd like a drink, please.
I'll take a drink that simply reeks of sophistication.
I'll take it.
I don't believe we've met. Who are you?
... Well...
What do you know about the lost ring of Blood Island?
Oh, I'm sorry. I wasn't listening. Uh, could you repeat that?
Hypothetically, how would one get into your aunt's tomb?
Oh, crud.
Again, how would one get into your kindly aunt's tomb?
Tell me that whole ring story again.
How can I get out to Skull Island?
Used to?
Almost?
Creepy. How's business?
Well, no...
You'd recite original poetry?
Isn't that some kind of fire hazard?
I'm sorry, I'm fascinated. Please go on.
Tragic. What happened to all the guests?
Is this going to be scary?  Because I warn you.
Would you let me into the guest room upstairs?
Maybe if you tried a more aggressive marketing scheme...
That's just gross.
Maybe if you booked some more entertainers..
Maybe if you focused on Blood Island's rich history...
Maybe you should get out of the hotel business.
That's stirring.
No, I meant... never mind. Eh, that's a shame. I'm sorry I brought it up. How can I get out to Skull Island?
I'm off to explore the rustic charms of Blood Island.
This village is deserted... How curious.
It's a table covered with different fruits and vegetables.
Very classy.
I'm Guybrush Threepwood, a mighty pirate!
Cannibals?!
No?
Really? That's fascinating.
Pair of dimes?
Hey!
But not anymore, right?
But, but not anymore, RIGHT!
Aren't you afraid the volcano will destroy your village?
The god of the volcano likes spicy foods?
O.K.
A reasonable assumption.
The usual.
What happened?
Ah. It all makes sense now.
Stand aside! I mean to visit the volcano!
Terrific! I'm fascinated by your quaint tribal customs!
That's so unfair!
When does the ceremony begin?
Human-like?
So what's the hold-up?
Who is your featured guest?
Uh... I'll help you find him. What does he look like?
You look familiar, somehow.
Oh, yeah! But it's more than that. We've met before. Back on Monkey Island.
Carnival!?
Yeah, yeah.
I REALLY want to see the volcano.
Oh, can't you make an exception just this once? It's an emergency!
I bring a gift for the volcano god!
I'm thinking of becoming a cannibal.
Well, I used to bite my fingernails.
Four years?  Uh... wait a second. Did I say "cannibal?" I, I meant to say... err, "cannon... ball." I want to be a cannon ball. BOOOOOMM
How quaint!
Do you live in fear of the fruit fly menace?
Very alluring.
Do they hassle you when you go through customs?
Nice village you have.
Gotta run. Bye.
Hey, uh, look here.  Sun-dried Spaniard crisps.
Nope. 100-percent Natural.
That looks like a mask. I'll just walk over here so he won't see me put this on.
Ick.
Ahem.
You feed the volcano mannequins made from vegetables?
Wow! That was more spectacular than I had hoped!
The volcano has erupted!
Well, I'm happy for ya.
What show is that?
I'm sure it will be a big hit. I'm off to explore the rustic charms of Blood Island.
Feel the Power of the Ancient Volcano Goddess in: "Griswold
Goodsoup Presents: High Explosive!" The most intense showgirl cabaret in the Caribbean. Starring Willamina, Temptress of the Caldera. Nightly at 7.
I'm not going to carry around that heavy iron pot for no reason.
That melted cheese looks just like yellow tar.
I guess I'll just drag this down to Haggis now.
Here, Haggis. This stuff should work to patch up the ship.
So, can I have your lotion now?
It's full of sea water.
Cool! A magnetic pin! The mind boggles at the possibilities!
Hey, neat! It points north! Science is fun when you know the secret!
I admit I had my doubts at first, but it looks really nice all put together.
That doesn't need to be lathered up.
Aahh, Pappapisshu! Here's your glass back.
I'd like a drink, please.
Give me a big, fruity drink with an umbrella in it.
Hey! Don't I get one of those decorative umbrellas to go in my tropical drink?
The bottle is closed.
Darn child-proof caps. I can't open it.
That opened it.
That makes the drink oh-so-much-more appealing
It just occurred to me that mixing medicine and alcohol is a really stupid and possibly lethal thing to do. If I were a real person instead of a loveably inept cartoon character with the potential for a few more sequels... ...I wouldn't even consider it.
Skoal!
That's odd. It's supposed to cause drowsiness.
I don't feel the least bit drowsy.
In fact, I, uh..
...in fact I feel...
...I feel...
Hey!
I'm not really dead!
Oh, come on, cut it out!
It won't open! I'm trapped!
Yikes!  Where is that tell-tale pounding coming from? It's coming from within one of these coffins... ...from the dead... ...the dead that surround me...
They must know my horrible secret!
They'll never let me rest until I've paid for the wrongs I've committed against...
Wait a second. I don't HAVE a horrible secret.
I think that knocking is coming from inside this coffin!
Uh, yes, well...
Well, you see, I've been meaning to...
I wasn't aware of that.
Well, no, but, but...
If you've been locked in that coffin, how were you able to have business cards made?
We're trapped in here! The door's locked!
It's locked tight.
There's someone in there.
What's a guy gotta do to get into one of these crypts?
Hi, guys! I guess you'll be wondering how I came to be back from the dead. No questions for the dead guy come back to life? No questions like: "Is there life after death?" or "Is there a heaven?" "Will there be adequate parking?" Fine! Be that way! I wouldn't tell you about the hereafter if you BEGGED me!
I thought if I died, I'd be buried with your aunt.
A member of the family, eh?
Uncle Griswold!  It's me!  Don't you recognize me?
I'm from California.
Look at me! Don't I look just like a Goodsoup?
I'm off to explore the rustic charms of Blood Island
It's a shameless ad for grog.
Hmmm... no.
There's something odd about this poster.
I can't quite figure out what's odd about this poster.
I've figured out what's wrong with this poster! It's her eye! No matter where I walk it always appears to be watching me. Pictures like that really creep me out.
Guybrush: Hmmm.
Hmmm.  I'd better get rid of this incriminating picture frame.
What?
It's locked.
I guess I'm better at this pirating thing than I thought!  It worked!
It's a really musty-smelling wardrobe.
It's so musty that I don't want to open it up.
Wow. I'll bet his room charges are pretty hefty right now.
Looks comfortable.
One nail will never be enough to hold down this bed.
I can't reach it.
I'm not sure if that's strong enough to hold it. I might need one more nail.
There. The bed has been nailed down. That ought to do it.
Gross.
"The Goodsoups: A Life in Pictures by M.M. Goodsoup"
There. I've cut out the face.
You've convinced me. I want to buy some insurance
Well... how much does it cost?
Well, I've got these wooden nickels!
How about an enormous, uncursed diamond?
Okay, no... ...but I'm, like, this close to getting one.
This antique, hand-crafted bottle of rich, creamy shaving soap. The closest, most comfortable shave possible!
This one-of-a-kind Big Whoop refrigerator magnet. Very collectable.
Coffin nails. All shapes and sizes. Hardly ever used.
This fine cane-handled umbrella. Makes a great gift!
This attractive mallet and chisel combination set. Use them separately, or as a pair!
An assortment of tarot cards. Practice the mystic art of fortune-telling at home or on vacation
This durable, high-impact glass mason jar. Includes lid, at no extra cost to you.
This highly-accurate map to Blood Island! I absolutely guarantee you won't find another one just like it.
This authentic pirate relic. A genuine tooth from an actual pirate! Only one of its kind.
The finest known to man. Not much spit on it, either, anymore.
What are the terms of this plan, exactly?
A lot of money! Wow!
Okay, I will. Thanks
Will do!
Look at me!  Don't I look just like a Goodsoup?
Clammy? Why, folks back home used to tell me all the time... "You're the spitting image of Old Chowder Goodsoup!"
I could just talk about Goodsoup history all day.
Oh, you mean the one that..
...Baron Salmon Bisque de Goodsoup began in 1621?
Actually, the VanSalads were not driven out until 1637... ...and the Goodsoup chain of restaurants and resorts never did become popular in the South Pacific.
I'm, uh, honored.
It's as if all my dreams have come true.
I'd like a drink, please.
All right!
Ominous.
It goes out to the cemetery.
Hey! There's a hole in the ceiling of this crypt! I think I might be able to squeeze through!
Wow! It's a tunnel that opens on a deep dark forest! It looks...  ...familiar, somehow.  As if I've seen it in a dream... Or maybe it's... ...I don't know.
Great jumpin' monkeys! A terrifying horde of stunningly-rendered rabid jaguars! They're coming right at me!
Whew! It's a good thing I couldn't get through that hole! I'd be done for!
The hole is too small for me to squeeze through.Eh, there's nothing interesting up here anyway. I'd better find another way out.
Yikes!
It's a ghost in a bride's gown. She looks very sad and lonely.
Ahem.
Who are you and what are you doing here?
What happened?
How many people can claim THAT?
Flooring inspector.
Wow. That bites.
Were there any other suitors you found attractive?
What happened to him?
Go into the light!
Yesyesyesyesyesyesyes
You bet!
Hey, nice ring!
Was it something I said?
Where's the diamond for your ring?
Who took it?
LeChuck is your schnoobums!?
Where did LeChuck take the diamond?
Since you're... uh... not using it, can I have your engagement band?
How do I get out of this crypt?
This is just a shade too creepy for me. I'm leaving!
"Goodsoup is Food"
It's your own fault! Stop scaring me like that
Well, startled is more like it.
But, but startled in a terrified kind of way! You really are very very scary!
I really don't have any choice.
No, I was only faking.
So what you're saying is that you only love me for my legs.
Hi, Murray.
Ick. I can barely see out of that mask.
Hey! Mister! Help!
There's been a horrifying mistake! I've been buried alive in the Goodsoup family crypt
It's no joke! I'm really trapped in here!
This isn't a trick! I'm REALLY trapped in this crypt! I drank a special potion that put me into a coma. Thinking I was dead, they buried me in this crypt.
Just come and look at me through this crack.
Curses  You've seen through my web of deceit! I'm no ordinary man trapped in a crypt!
I seek the Golden Rods of C'thon to bring peace to the shire!
I was hoping you wouldn't ask. What I meant to say was... My faster than light ship is trapped in a subspace anomaly!
What I meant to say was... I'm an angry and deranged ghost haunting this crypt!
Excuse me?
Isn't the ominous sound of my disembodied voice proof enough? I guess not.
Bwahahahaha! Fear me! I'm an evil ghost!
I can't. I'm shy.
I'm going to haunt you until you set me free.
Not right now.
You must love horror stories to own all these collectibles.
Why are you wasting your money on all this bad fiction?
I see your point. LET ME OUT OF THIS CRYPT!
I'm going to go sulk in the darkness now.
I can't reach.
That can reach the lantern, but it won't grab hold.
Alas, I can't use Murray with that.
Hey, Murray, be fearsome!
Hey, Murray, be fearsome!
Murray, do your stuff!
Great work, Murray!
Uh, hi.
I'll just check back in with you later.
Uh-oh.
I don't think I want you walking around freely, Murray.
I'm getting out of here.
Well, Murray, are you ready to continue our heady adventuring? Murray? Where'd he go?
Hey! What an amazing story I have to tell! I was dead, but I live again!  Who wants to hear about it?
Eh, you guys don't deserve to hear a good story!
"This hereby certifies that... ...Vegetable Goodsoup... ...met his demise (at least once) on Blood Island."
The Murphy bed has slammed up so many times it's made a hole in the wall.
I can see the Goodsoup crypt from here.
I'm cashing in this insurance policy. Give me a lot of money.
No, honest! I WAS dead for a really long time!
Well, yes.
As a matter of fact, smart guy... I've got your proof right here!
A death certificate!
Uh-uh. It's right there, in high-res black-and-white. I died. Give me a lot of money.
No! Just give me my money!
Oh. Thanks.
Excuse me, but...
High risk? I'm young, don't smoke... ...and I run away screaming from any sort of life-threatening situation.
Well, there IS that...
Pirates don't drink purified water.
No, I didn't! It's right there! Look!
It's from all that drinking.
But I was going to put a whole lot of money in it... ...too much for me to carry around with me... ...so I'm going to have to take it with me and fill it up.
It's locked.
It's full of fermenting sugar water used for making rum.
It's full of sugar-water now.
Elaine looks like she's all right. HANG... ON... HONEY! I'M... GOING... TO... GET... YOU... OUT... OF... THIS... MESS!
Eh, it doesn't look like she's hurt... ...well, except for that whole turned-to-gold-by-a-pirate-curse thing.
They sure are bright.
It's full of yummy, delicious sugar water!  Mmmm... bet that water sure tastes good!
There. I've poked holes in it.
They're trapped inside and glowing like mad!
Boy! It's windy up here!
Perfect.
It's broken.
The lighthouse is working now.
Who are you?
Ooooh.
Really?  I like mist.  I think it's pretty
I'd like a ride out to Skull Island, please.
Well, you know, I just happen to have a compass right here.
I'm not afraid!
That's a duck!
This island doesn't look like a skull at all! It looks like a great big, enormous duck!  It should be called Duck Island!
If you squint and turn your head it looks like a bunny.
But how do I get up there?
Won't you be coming with me?
Thanks.
I bet he can help me find the Smugglers' Cave
Hello. Can you tell me how to find the evil smugglers of Skull Island?
It looks pretty rickety. Are you sure it's safe?
I guess that'll be O.K. What's your name?
Would you lower me down to the smugglers' cave?
Actually, more like a hundred twenty.
Now you're sure about this?
Hmmm.
Okay, give me a little bit more slack.
Okay, that's too much slack. Ahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!
Let's try that lowering-me-down-the-cliff thing again.
Please be careful this time.
Do you think you'll be able to lower me down this time?
Just try lowering me, one more time.
Stand aside or I'll strike you down!
Err... I'll strike you down with how polite and reasonable I can be.
Darn. Let me try that again. Hi there, neighbor! Got any diamonds? Wouldn't you know but I'm fresh out!
Darn. Let me try that again. So, uh, where's this huge diamond you guys are supposed to have?
Darn. Let me try that again. Good afternoon. I'm the new Skull Island diamond inspector... I'm going to have to see every diamond you've got. Every last one. Come on, people!  Chop chop!  I don't have all day!
Darn. Let me try that again. I have got SO much money it's almost embarrassing.
Threepwood. Guybrush Threepwood.
Arr, LeChuck. Zombie Pirate LeChuck.
Hey! How did you know my...
The Goodsoup family diamond. LeChuck stole it, you bought it, I want it. Now.
Please.  Sir.
Could you not laugh like that anymore?
So can I have it?
Do you expect me to talk?
Your evil plan will never work, André!
You're a madman!
Good point. I take it back.
That diamond belongs in a museum!
What the heck is THAT supposed to mean?
Maybe we could make a deal.
I'll take it!
Eh, enough with the hard sell. How much?
Well, I have a lot of money.
Sounds fair.
Could you stop laughing like that?  It's very unnerving.
Sounds fun! Deal me in, baldy!
Well, how much do I need?
Sure, I can handle that. This is a lot of money.  I'd better only give them part of it.
No! Would you believe this is my very first time?
How do I know what makes the best hand?
Of course I trust you!
No whammies! No whammies!
Good cards! Daddy needs to lift a pirate curse
Two of spades, three of hearts, four of clubs, eight of clubs, and, a king of diamonds. What a terrible hand!
The future is in my hands!
Fortune-telling won't work with that.
Five of a kind. Right there. Not even you guys can beat five of a kind.
A pair?
Huh?
OHHHH... I get it. "Whether or not you can beat a pair." That's pretty clever.
Now, now, gentlemen... Let's not be too hasty.
I got the diamond!
Got what I needed from the smugglers.
There's just one thing I need to do first.
What? You can't mean...
You'll be sorely missed.
Farewell, good friend Welshman!
East by Northeast. You can't miss it.
Ah! Whoops. I forgot to tell him that a magnetized pin will only have compass-like properties for a short time.
That ring is really stuck on her finger. Let's see if this slippery greasy lotion does the trick.
That should do it.
The cursed ring exploded!
It's a massive diamond engagement ring.
Ooooh!
Umm, Elaine? Are you alright?
You're O.K. We're on Blood Island
You're safe and everything's gonna be fine, just---fiiine.
Where... where are we?
Wait! I can remember! I've seen this place before... in some terrible nightmare!
OH NO! IT CAN'T BE! BUT IT IS! This is the Carnival of the Damned!
You fiend! Why have you brought us here?
Eh, you're wasting your time, LeChuck! Elaine's love can't be bought.
Big Whoop!
What's so special about the treasure of Big Whoop? Isn't it just like any other pirate treasure?
I guess not.
O.K.
Yipe! But how will Big Whoop make Elaine love you?
But... at... what... cost?
But if you kill Elaine, won't she hate you even more?
This whole amusement park... why?
I see. But again, why an amusement park?
Okay, but why an amusement park?
You're right. I've been rude. Please go on.
Err...?
Oh, that.  He, he, he.  Of course.
That doesn't sound the least bit fun.
How did you find Big Whoop?
Does the torture start after we're done talking here?
No!
Been there. Done that.
Hold on. Can I sit down? Both my legs are going to sleep.
The ability to kill bugs just by breathing?
You scum!
All right, LeChuck! Was she hot  Did you kiss her?
Oh, come on. You can tell me.
I'm still confused about the carnival...
How did you build an amusement park on a deserted island?
That must have been back-breaking work!
What kind of attractions do you have?
Fascinating. How do you power all the rides?
Well, of course.
Nuclear?
My word!
That's so inhumane!
Mark my words, LeChuck! When I finally defeat you, I'll be sure to set them all free.
What's in the future for Big Whoop theme parks?
I thought the treasure of Big Whoop was on Dinky Island.
Very tidy explanation.
I'VE HEARD QUITE ENOUGH ABOUT YOUR DISGUSTING THEME PARK!
What happened to Captain Marley and his crew?
What happened to Rum Rogers, Sr.?
Shocking.
What happened to Rapp Scallion, the cook?
That's right! I brought him back to life with a voodoo spell! I remember it so vividly..
Oh, I'm sorry, I was miles away. What were you saying?
That's horrible!
What became of Young Lindy, the cabin boy?
No one could be THAT desperate! What fate befell Captain Marley?
Well? What'd he say?
You're unbelievably ghastly and wretched!
What is the secret of Monkey Island?
That "Rosebud" is a sled?
That the guy's girlfriend is really a man?
You don't even know The Secret of Monkey Island, do you?
All right, then. Please don't kill me.
If you kill me... ...you'll crush the hopes of children all over the world! I'm a hero to millions.
Pretty please don't kill me.
If you kill me... ...you'll be in really big trouble.
Yeah, well...
If you kill me... ...there'll be no more Monkey Island sequels. No sequels means no work for you. You'll become just another has-been that nobody's heard of.
Do you know the name "Bobbin Threadbare"?
Exactly.
If you kill me... ...you'll ruin our reputation for making family-oriented games. We'll be scorned by parent watchdog groups everywhere.
Elaine will never marry you! She loves me!
Nuh-uh. She loves me
Anyway, Elaine really loves me.
Does too love me!
Does too. Infinity.
I'm not listening to you anymore. See? I'm ignoring you.
LA LA LA LA LA LA LA, I CAN'T HEAR YOU, LA LA LA LA LA LA!
Uh oh!
Aha! It's not locked! Your plan was flawless, LeChuck, except for one minor detail. That will be your downfall!
He's taken Elaine on his roller coaster of death! I've got to reach her before she becomes his undead bride!
What's happened to me? Head... foggy... can't... think... Mind... swimming... must... concentrate... ...and rescue Elaine! I've got to save Elaine! But how can I save Elaine when I'm just a little boy? Oooh, if only I could think straight!
Must... clear... my mind!
Oh, for cryin' out loud!
Yo, Murray.
Yeah. Let me get back to you on that.
It says, "Guess Yer Age 'n Weight."
Are you the real Dinghy Dog™?
Okay, for starters, I'm not a little boy. I'm Guybrush Threepwood. Mighty Pirate.
Don't you patronize me.
Laugh while you can. Soon I'll destroy LeChuck and your entire world will lie in ruin.
I'd like to speak to your manager.
I really want to talk to somebody in charge.
I need to get on the roller coaster!
I don't care if it's not safe! I have to ride it, now!
Let me on the roller coaster!
How can I win one of these fabulous prizes?
What's the catch?
Just try to guess how much I weigh.
HA! The joke's on you!
I just LOOK like a little boy! In actuality, I'm a mighty pirate weighing in at...
...ninety-eight pounds. This is really embarrassing.  Am I not eating right?  I've been working out.
I'll bet you can't guess how old I am.
HA! Wrong! I just so happen to be twenty!
You calling me a liar?
I have my proof right here.
Give me that anchor!
I really want that talking skull.
Mmm... You're right, Murray. If I had all that power, the temptation for evil would be too great. I'll take the anchor!
It's a really nice anchor, Murray. Sorry.
Peeeewwww!!
Yikes! What is that horrible smell?
What are you guys doing here?
What flavor?
What flavor are the pies today?
How does this whole booth work again?
I want to shoot the cannon!  I want to shoot the cannon!
That's discrimination! How do I know it really works if I can't see it go off?
What in the world is meringue?
What's Dinghy Dog™ really like in person?
Could you, uh, introduce me to Dinghy Dog™?
Dinghy Dog™ is really cool, huh?
I bet Dinghy Dog™ gets paid a lot of money, right?
I bet his suit doesn't stink, either.
I bet Dinghy Dog™ could beat you up.
I bet he could.
Never mind.
I just want one of those pies...
Now it's a heavy pie pan.
Now I've got a heavy pie pan full of shaving cream.
I've got a pie pan full of shaving cream.
Now it's a heavy pie pan full of shaving cream.
I found this pie, Mister.
Shoot it! Shoot it!
Oh, but I want to see the cannon fire!
Look, man. I pay your salary! You want me to tell LeChuck you've got unhappy kids running around here?
No.
Yoo-hoo! Stinky Mr. Rat!
What ya gonna do about it, vermin-boy?
Ow! He bit me!
"You must be as tall as my hand to ride the rollercoaster."
What kind of snow cones do you have?
Hmmm.
I'd like a plain snowcone, please.
Ick.
I'd rather keep these pie bits for a better time.
Eeeew. Hairy.
Mmmm. Peppery goodness.
Bean Curdy.
Pasty.
Eeeew! The pepper helps, though.
Yeeaaaah. Brain freeze.
Where are they?!!
I had a feeling he'd turn up sooner or later.
Naw.
It's a mechanical Herman Toothrot.
This one doesn't talk. Thank you, technology!
Errr... gesundheit?
Uh-oh.
It's Captain Marley, Elaine's grandfather.
It's Rum Rogers, Sr. as he appeared in life.
Errr... gesundheit?
Darn!
Youch! Ow!
It's very lifelike... I mean "deathlike."
I'm glad to see that I'm featured among the attractions here.
Youch!  Ow!
It's every sailor's worst nightmare. The "Giant, Snowy Ape."
There. It's soaked in oil and probably highly flammable.
Cool!
Oh no! It's LeChuck!
Hi! My name's Guybrush Threepwood, and I want to be a pirate!
Er... I'm over this way.
THREEPWOOD. Guybrush THREEPWOOD.
Gosh, thanks! I'll do that! Bye, now. I'm off to seek my fortune.
Right. Thanks.
My name's Guybrush Threepwood. I'm new in town.
I don't know... I kind of like 'Guybrush.'
Well, what's YOUR name?
I want to be a pirate!
Where can I find the Governor?
Why not?
How's that?
I'd like to introduce myself... my name's Guybrush.
Who's this pirate that's bugging the Governor?
What's so scary about this LeChuck guy?
What happened then?
What happened to your eye?
Excuse me, but I'm looking for the dart board.
Where can I get a drink?
Aye, yourself.
Nice hat.
So, tell me about LOOM.
Geeze, what an obvious sales pitch.
Nice talking to you.
Woof.
Wuf, 'LeChuck?'
I want to be a fireman.
I mean to kill you all!
I want to be a pirate.
I can hold my breath for ten minutes!
Er... What three trials are those?
Tell me more about mastering the sword.
Tell me more about mastering the art of thievery.
Tell me more about treasure hunting.
Should I have a map or something?
You're a bunch of foul-smelling, grog-swilling pigs!
What's in that grog stuff, anyway?
I'll just be running along now.
No, but I once had a barber named Dominique.
No thanks. I don't have enough money.
Hey, nice rat!
Yes, I love rats!
That's amazing!
Do you guys know the sneaky-looking man on the opposite corner?
No, but I'll take one if you give me two pieces of eight.
Say, are you guys pirates?
What's in the keg?
I'm really interested in this pirating thing.
How come you're on this street corner and not on a ship, looting,
Maybe no one will miss just this one thing.
Why don't you want it? Is it jinxed with an ancient voodoo curse?
Lucky guess. Half the people I know are named Guybrush. 
Journey? What can you tell me about my journey?
Yeah!
What? See what?
Yikes!
Gross.
What kind of things? I hate surprises.
Yikes!
Hello? Anybody in here? HELLO???
Yeah, and bad things happen to people who sneak up on other people
I'm Guybrush Threepwood, and I'm a mighty pirate.
Threepwood! Guybrush Threepwood!
Boy, I feel much better knowing there's an officer of the law
Not to mention halitosis.
I could really use a breath mint.
I think I'd just like to browse.
Who are you?
But why are you in jail, if you're innocent?
What flowers?
Can I get you anything?
So, how's the food in there?
What was so odd about the rump roast?
Sheriff Shinetop sure is a jerk, isn't he?
He IS filthy. And he smells bad too.
Sorry.
Why are you guys dressed up in those ridiculous
How much will you pay me?
OK, sounds good.
Er... no, I don't have a helmet. Will I need one?
Of course I have a helmet. What sort of idiot do you take me for?
About this sword...
How much is it?
I'll take it.
I'd like some rat repellent, please.
About this shovel...
How much is it?
I'll take it.
I think I'd just like to browse.
Look behind you! A mouse!
Stand aside, troll, I'm a mighty pirate.
I can out-insult anybody, you brainless clay doppelganger!
Oh, please, can't I pass?
How much is the toll?
A rubber chicken with a pulley in the middle?
My old moss-covered three-handled family credenza?
How much did you say the toll was?
Captain Smirk's Big Body Pirate Gym
I think I'll knock. It'd only be polite.
Um, could you please put out that cigar? It's not good for your
Uh... ...maybe I'll just leave instead.
Do you know where the Sword Master lives?
Can we step inside? It's a little chilly out here.
I said it's a little chilly out here!
Could you train me to be better than the Sword Master?
I do so have what it takes!
I do so!
I do so!
All I have is this dead chicken.
I figured you'd do it for free.
I've got 30 pieces of eight.
I do have this deadly-looking chicken.
OK, check it out.
Machine? Is this going to hurt?
Yikes!
You must be thinking of someone else, I am not a farmer.
How appropriate. You fight like a cow.
I can't help but feel like I've been ripped off. I'm sure you're
Nice night we're having, isn't it?
How do you guys talk so funny?
My name is Guybrush Threepwood. Prepare to die!
Ever notice how all these roads start to look the same?
My name is Guybrush Threepwood. Prepare to die!
I'm looking for the Sword Master of Mêlée Island™.
I don't think strolling through the forest picking flowers is very
I better just stay back here and eavesdrop.
Hi, I'm selling these fine leather jackets.
Yep, nailed right on the head... gee, you're smart.
Even BEFORE they smell your breath?
I wanted to make sure you'd feel comfortable with me.
You run THAT fast?
And I've got a little TIP for you. Get the POINT?
Too bad no one's ever heard of YOU at all.
He must have taught you everything you know.
I'm glad to hear you attended your family reunion.
I'm the deadliest scalawag what ever swung a sword!
I'll just be running along now.
On those helpless dogs?
Better leave this here.
It's a big, ugly, hairy yak wearing some wax lips.
I can't move it.
I can't move it.
I'll need this. I must be nuts!
Acck!
It's beautiful!
I can't open it. Uh, oh!
That should hold him for a while! If only I had a file I could get
There's a file in it!
I've got the file.
Phew! That was a close one. At least I got the idol.
Uh-oh.
Look, I can explain...
They're just sleeping!
The door was unlocked!
No, you've got it all wrong!
The pirate leaders told me to do it!
Gee...
Jeepers...
Grlpyt...
Bgglw! Mfrnkf? Dmnkly...
I'm going to go put this idol in my safe-deposit box.
Uh-oh.
I can't reach that from here.
Gee, I don't know how much longer I can hold my breath...
I guess I'll be needing a sword. This one will do.
Governor!
What are YOU doing here? Come to finish the job?
You came down here to rescue me? I didn't even think you liked me.
But I'm not one of your citizens... ...I'm just a drifter, a
Who would have known, or even cared, if
Oh, Governor...
Oh, Elaine!
Love muffin! 
Honey pumpkin!
Kiss me!
What?
Why, are you ashamed of me?
Okay then, let's go to your place.
But...
I feel this sudden urge to complete the trials... ...quickly.
I'm the sneakiest footpad in these isles!
I'll just be running along now.
I'll take it. It'll make a swell gift.
I think I've been had! This is no map! It looks like... ...dancing
'The Legendary Lost Treasure of Mêlée Island™'
Here lies treasure of such unimaginable wealth... ...well, you'll
This shouldn't take too long.
Hey, I think I hit something!
What was that? I'm so confused.
What? By whom?
So where were you this whole time? Sleeping?
I'll go get a crew and a ship and go rescue her!
Attention, pirates of Mêlée: Your governor is alive and well and by
Hey! I'm back and I'm ready to know more about the future.
Yikes!
I really hate that flashing, it makes me see spots.
Must what?
What?
Yeah!
Spill it!
Great.
Don't worry, I'll watch out for LeChuck.
Did you know the Governor's been kidnapped?
Can I interest you in a dream vacation to Monkey Island™?
Where are all the pirates?
What can I do to save her?
Why should I do that?
Where can I get a ship?
Will you join me?
Get me a drink!
Right! I'm off! 
This stuff is eating right through the mug!
Well, actually, there is something... I'm looking for brave people
I can't believe I fell for that. Pretty good
I'm here to loot the Governor's mansion.
Reservations?!? For looting?
Why, yes I do have reservations.
Threepwood, Guybrush Threepwood.
No thanks, I've got a ship to catch.
I want to embarass you at swordfighting again.
I want us to make up and be friends.
The Governor's been KIDNAPPED!
I'm getting a ship and a crew together to rescue her.
I'm a pirate, cannonball-head. Who are you?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to call you cannonball-head.
I meant to call you chrome dome.
Excuse me, but the sign said there were restrooms in here?
What was your name again, cannonball-head? 
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to call you cannonball-head.
Ha ha ha.
Yes, please show me, Mr. Meat.
The Governor's been KIDNAPPED!
Oh really?
We could get a crew together and sail off after them.
What about me?
Hey, I'm serious.
Really.
Wait!
No, I just don't know what I'm supposed to do.
Oh, is that all?
Oh, come on, Meathook. You're a big, strong, good-looking guy with
Sure.
Just pack your stuff and meet me at the dock.
Wow, this is sounding better and better all the time.
Let me see the best ship you've got.
Money is no object!
All I have is this rubber chicken.
Actually, I was hoping to get one on credit.
Oh... no more than 174 pieces of eight.
On second thought, this may not be the ship for me.
Something not too expensive, but built to last.
Oh... no more than 174 pieces of eight.
On second thought, this may not be the ship for me.
That spiffy blue one by your office looks nice.
I really don't have that much to spend.
Chimps? There aren't any chimps in the Caribbean! 
Oh... no more than 174 pieces of eight.
On second thought, this may not be the ship for me.
Actually, I'd like to go think about it some more.
A compass?
With your picture on it...
Right.
I'm interested in procuring a note of credit.
Yes, of course I do.
I'm a grog-swilling, foul-smelling pirate.
I'm looking for the Sword Master of Mêlée Island™.
Maybe if you asked her again? Hmmm... I guess I could hike all the
Hmmm... There's nothing in here but this note.
Uh... could I see that red one again?
I got credit from the storekeeper. Will you take it?
Uh... could I see that Viking one again?
I got credit from the storekeeper. Will you take it?
Uh... how much do you want for yours?
Uh, could I see that cheap one again?
I got credit from the storekeeper. Will you take it?
Uh... right.
Well, what do you think it's worth?
Let's talk extras.
I think I can live without that particular piece of junk.
I think I can live without that particular piece of junk.
I think I can live without that particular piece of junk.
I think I can live without that particular piece of junk.
I think I can live without that particular piece of junk.
I think I can live without that particular piece of junk.
I think I can live without that particular piece of junk.
Enough about extras, already. 
Well, what do you think it's worth? 
I'd like to make you an offer. 
I'd like to pay 2000 pieces of eight.
I'd like to make you an offer.
How does 3000 pieces of eight sound?
I'd like to make you an offer.
Okay, okay. 4000 pieces of eight.
I'd like to make you an offer.
All right! 5000! But that's my final offer!
Maybe I should have gotten that extended warranty after all.
Have you come to be on my crew?
Money?
How appropriate. You fight like a cow.
This isn't going to be as easy as I thought.
First of all... I'd like to say it's great to be working with such
I made a list.
--sigh--
I'm doomed. 
It says: 
Hey guys, what's happening?
Is there anything I can do to get you guys to help me?
I'm going to give you mutineers five seconds to come to your
Keelhaul
I hear the weather's pretty nice over by Monkey Island™.
Hmmmm.... I loved this stuff when I was a kid. I liked the way it
 Crunch Crunch Crunch Crunch GREAT! A toy prize inside.
This is no prize! It's a small key with a finely engraved monkey on
Man, that's heavy. Filled, no doubt, with gold and jewels. 
He look! A piece of paper. And some cinnamon sticks.
Fsspt. I feel awful.
Holy Monkey Bladders! It's Monkey Island™.
Hey look... ...we've made it to Monkey Island™.
"NOTICE OF PUBLIC MEETING"
The trail ends here.
Er, sorry.
It's printed on letterhead!
I got taken by a guy named Stan...
Are you some kind of a castaway?
Who are you talking to?
Um... sure.
Were you stranded?
Boy, it sure is HOT here.
"To the Monkey Island™ Cannibals:"
"Herman--"
He looks pretty bad...
I'm Guybrush. I'm here to rescue someone.
Er... That's not exactly what I meant. I sailed here in pursuit of
Um... Well, perhaps I could take you back, too... ...but I've got
What happened to your pants?
How did you get stranded here?
How come you didn't just go with the chimps?
You're the only one on the island?
Did you lend something to the cannibals?
Why don't you just give me the key to the Monkey Head?
Excuse me, I've got pressing business to attend to.
AAA!!!
"To the Monkey Island™ Cannibals:"
It's either an incisive representation of the futility of man...
Yes, it IS a nice view. Excuse me, I've got pressing business to
Whoops...
"Mr. Toothrot:"
Wow! Looked like it hit the big banana tree on the beach! I bet the
Rubber tree.
I would have knocked, but I couldn't find a door.
Excuse me, I've got pressing business to attend to.
I can paddle it with these oars.
There's a message in it! It's a memo...
"PRIVATE PROPERTY"
Yes, it's quite impressive.
Excuse me, I've got pressing business to attend to.
Hi! Seen any big, ugly, scary, see-through pirates around here?
Hi! Is there anything good to eat on this island?
Hi! I'm here to rescue the Governor of Mêlée Island™.
Hi! I think I'm going nuts. I've got to hurry up and rescue the
"Cannibals--"
You're cannibals?!
Look behind you! A three-headed monkey!
Look behind you! A three-headed monkey!
"To the ghost pirate LeChuck:"
I might fit through that hole, but I don't think this banana picker
I doubt anyone will miss this piece of junk.
This is much too heavy to pick up... let alone carry around this
Don't eat me! I'm a mighty pirate!
I have your banana picker.
OK. And don't worry, I won't use it or anything.
Well, actually, there is something...
Money. I want money.
I need a ship.
Well, this big rock fell out of the sky...
I'm looking for somebody. 
I'm looking for 30 dead guys and one woman.
Then you've seen the ghost pirate LeChuck and his cadaverous crew?
Give me the potion! I'll use it on LeChuck!
Why not?
LeChuck came in here and stole your root? What a cad!
Where is he hiding it?
What happened? Health department shut you down?
I'm off to find LeChuck and get the root!
The what?
Why are you guys talking in pig Latin?
--ahem--
I know, but I really need that navigator head thing.
Thanks.
Yeah!
I had a feeling that in hell there would be mushrooms.
Uhh... You wouldn't happen to have a root I could borrow? Yikes!
Hello, head.
Thank you for leading me to the ghost ship.
May I please have that necklace?
Why can't I have it?
Why can't I have it?
Maybe I'll just take it...
I don't want to have to hurt you...
What're you going to do? Bite me?
If I wanted to I could dropkick you into the lava.
This feels weird.
Yikes! I hate rats!
Yech, it's all over my hands.
This should stop it from squeaking.
Oh good, more inventory.
This should do it...
I'll just grab this old root and be on my way.
I did it! I got the root!
I'd love to have you stuffed. I'd make a fortune.
Thanks.
What happened to the ship?
What wedding?
WHAT? But how will they... Where is the wedding?
Mêlée Island™? Oh, no! Why are YOU still here?
I've got to go after them! I've got to stop that wedding!!
...hey... How did you get in here without a head?
If you have a ship, why are you waiting to be rescued?
Will you take me to Mêlée Island™?
OK.
Well, that was certainly easier than the trip TO Monkey Island™.
Yikes!
I'm selling this fine mouthwash.
Cool!
I must have left it in my other pants. Bye now.
I suffer from a rare pigmentation efficiency syndrome.
My chains are at the cleaners being degreased.
It's busy being overpowered by your OWN deathly stench.
You mean the head on this root beer?
STOP THE WEDDING!!
Take THIS, you vaporous voodoo vermin!
Governor!
How did you manage to escape?
I thought LeChuck was going to marry you.
If you're here, then who's that in the dress?
What?
Oh, I'll get it!
...oops...
...but... ...I... ...er... ...hey... 
Well, I can't believe your stupidity.
Well, I can't believe your enormity.
Well, I can't believe your atrocity.
Well, I can't believe your alacrity.
...Er... ...say, now... ...let's not be hasty...
Yikes! Don't sneak up on me like that!
That's OK. You know, LeChuck was a deviant, obnoxious, slithery,
He sure looks nice exploding against the night sky.
Actually, I'm a bit sick of root beer. While I was in the machine
I wish me crew could have seen this...
At least I learned something from all of this...
How to deal with frustation, disappointment, and irritating
Yikes!
